# Global and fast code-deployment system
design a code deployment system (part of exercise at Algoexpert/System design) 

# The initial questions 

The first questions is of course buy or build, but for the point of the exercise we will ask the questions needed for a design, and a later implementation. The second questions is whether this suits the company and the overall architecture and whether the resources are in place to, after the design, actually be able to build the system. As shown later in the design phase, it is pretty complicated. 

The following, and other questions will help us to understand the specific requirements and constraints of the code-deployment system, enabling you to design a solution the meets the needs of the organisation. 

## Scope and Scale

- How many locations or regions will the system need to support globally?
- What is the expected number of deployments per day or per hour?
- Are there any specific performance or latency requirements?

## Target Environments

- What types of environments will the code be deployed to (e.g., cloud-based, on-premises, hybrid)?
- Are there any specific platforms, operating systems, or architectures that need to be supported?

## Security Requirements

- What security measures need to be in place to protect the code during deployment?
- Are there any specific authentication or authorization requirements?
- Is there a need for encryption or secure communication channels?

## Versioning and Rollbacks

- How should the system handle versioning of the deployed code?
- Is there a need for the ability to rollback to a previous version in case of issues or failures?

## Deployment Workflow

- What is the desired workflow for code deployment (e.g., continuous integration/continuous deployment, manual approval process)?
- Are there any specific pre-deployment or post-deployment tasks that need to be performed?


## Monitoring and Logging

- What metrics and logging information should be captured during deployment?
- Are there any specific monitoring or alerting requirements in case of deployment failures?

## Network and Infrastructure

- What are the available network bandwidth and infrastructure capabilities across different regions?
- Are there any limitations or considerations related to firewalls, load balancers, or other networking components?

## Compliance and Governance

- Are there any compliance requirements or industry-specific regulations that need to be considered during code deployment?

## Integration and Compatibility

- Does the code-deployment system need to integrate with any existing tools or systems (e.g., version control, configuration management)?
- Are there any dependencies or restrictions regarding the technologies or programming languages used in the code?

## Team and Roles

- Who will be responsible for managing and operating the code-deployment system?
- What are the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved in the deployment process?
